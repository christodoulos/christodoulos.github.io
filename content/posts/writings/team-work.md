There are four people named **Everybody**, **Somebody**, **Anybody** and **Nobody**. There was an important job to be done and **Everybody** was asked to do it. **Everybody** was sure **Somebody** would do it, **Anybody** could have done it but **Nobody** did it.

**Somebody** got angry about that because it was **Everybody's** job. **Everybody** thought **Anybody** could do it, but **Nobody** realized that **Everybody** wouldn't do it. It ended up that **Everybody** blamed **Somebody** when **Nobody** did what **Anybody** could have done.
