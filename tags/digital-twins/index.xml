These endpoints can be anything from devices and services to applications, and eventually, data needs to be stored somewhere for further processing and analysis.
So let’s say you want to build a Digital Twin where a device will measure temperature and humidity values from sensors and send them to a database service to store them. Then you want to have a web application that will fetch these values and display them in a dashboard.</description></item><item><title>The big picture</title><link>http://fragkoudakis.gr/posts/digital-twins/the-big-picture/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://fragkoudakis.gr/posts/digital-twins/the-big-picture/</guid><description>A bird’s eye view of a Digital Twin implementation that incorporates modern technological advancements could be depicted in the following figure. Clients are running the Digital Twin’s frontend that displays objects bound to backend entities. The front-end implementation uses “observable” constructs, adjusting displayed objects to “live” back-end queries. The backend implementation involves a sensor cloud that constantly updates a real-time database. The real-time database automatically pushes updates to every connected client.</description></item></channel></rss>
