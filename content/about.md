My name is Christodoulos Fragkoudakis. I am the associate director of the central [Computer Center][computer center] facility of the National Technical University of Athens ([NTUA][ntua]) in Greece. For more than fifteen years in the computer center, I administer the systems and network infrastructure. I participate in an ongoing effort of a cloud computing transition. I design and [implement][cloudpaper] cloud computing services on top of [free][floss] operating systems and applications. Recently I joined the so-called "ΕΔΙΠ" faculty of NTUA.

I am a Linux and Python enthusiast. I like long runs, and last year I finished my first marathon. I dislike many things around me, but I try to keep an [open mind][open mind]. My daily life as a [devoted to duty][devoted] administrator involves a lot of responsibilities and [teamwork][teamwork]. Last but not least, I can tie my [shoelaces][shoelace] very fast.

I obtained a Ph.D. in computer science from NTUA's [Electrical and Computer Engineering][ntuaecedept] Department in 2007. I studied computational geometry and specifically [Art Gallery problems][art gallery]. The connection between the art gallery problems and the fact that my [wife][wife] is a painter is a pure coincidence. Since then, I worked as a short term assistant professor in the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications at the National University of Athens (NUA) and as a short term lecturer in the Department of Informatics at the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB). I instructed Computational Geometry, Discrete Mathematics, and Theory of Computation classes.

I have been around in NTUA since 1994. I guess that makes me old. I was an active member of [ΕρΓΑ][erga] and [CORELAB][corelab]. In a previous life, I have been a [geologist][how to spot a geologist] (at least as an undergraduate in [NUA][geonua]).

## Is it Fragoudakis or Fragkoudakis?

The actual _Fragoudakis_ that appears as an author in my publications ([here][dblp], and [here][igi]) is me. That is because I used to use _Fragoudakis_ as my surname during my early publishing attempts. Back then, the Greek authorities did not impose an English translation of names on the ID card. My name in Greek is _Χριστόδουλος Φραγκουδάκης_. The diphthong _γκ_ in _Φραγκουδάκης_ sounds in Greek like the letter g in almost every English word that I know. The Greek authorities decided to make a one to one correspondence from the Greek alphabet to the English one. So the Greek letter _γ_ corresponds to _g_ while _κ_ corresponds to _k_. The latter explains the ugly and unpronounceable _Fragkoudakis_ on my ID card.
